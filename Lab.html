      <h3>Ingredients you'll need:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Pieces of Bread</li>
        <li>2 Pats of Butter</li>

    <section>
      <h3>Process:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Fetch yourself a fat-bottom skillet</li>
        <li>Heat the skillet over medium heat</li>
        <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread</li>
        <li>
          Place one slice of the buttered bread, buttered side down, into the
          skillet
        </li>
        <li>
          Quickly place each slice of cheese on the bread, being sure to cover
          the entire surface area
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the other slice of bread, butter side up, on top of the cheese
        </li>
        <li>
          Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes (or till the bread touching the
          skillet is a golden brown)
        </li>
        <li>
          Flip the sandwich over with some awesome pizazz and cook the other
          side till golden brown (approximately 1 to 2 minutes)
        </li>
        <li>
          Eat with ketchup, or just enjoy the plain crispy goodness of your
          grilled cheese
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>
        Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using
        a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you
        to make many more for you and your friends. Remember, Shaun says
        "Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!".
